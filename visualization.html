          <p>In this visualization we explore a data set about video games sales and critics. This data set <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings">comes from Kaggle</a> and includes, among others, information about games such as their genre, publisher, year of release, user critic scores, sales and console avaibility.
We present our visualization in three parts. The first part, entitled "Consoles War", is an exploration of the popularity of the different consoles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <p>We look at two metrics : the number of sales and the number of game releases for each console. We also look the relationship between video game genres and consoles to determine whereas some consoles are more popular in certain specific genres.
"Publisher War" is our second part. Here we look at the sales for each publisher to see which are the most important ones.
We display both over-the-years and all-time sales.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <p>
Note that our data set also provided information about sales in different regions of the world and it is possible to filter the sales for each region on our visualizations.
At last, our third part is called "Game Analysis" and brings all the dimensions of our dataset into a single interactive representation. It allows for exploring games and it will maybe let you discover great games you didn't know about.</p>

      <!-- Console War -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs">

            <h1>The consoles war</h1></section>

                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <h2>Games releases</h2>
          <p>A first interesting metric is the amount of games released for each console over the years. We've grouped those by manufacturers :</p>
          <img class="full_width" src="./img/manufacturers.svg" />
          <p>Atari was first in the console industry but died quicky (will it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataribox">come back</a> ?). Then arrived Nintendo, Sony and only later Microsoft. We can observe a peak of game release around year 2009,
            mainly due to the amount of games for mobile consoles such as Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP but also because of the success of the Wii.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-8
                col-lg-8">
          <div id="consoleReleaseYears_container" class="row stackArea_chart"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row_padded">
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-6
                col-lg-6">
          <p>This peak is followed by a collapse which is essentially because of the vanishing of those mobile consoles (maybe because of the developement of smartphones games ?) despite the efforts of Nintendo with the release of Nintendo 3DS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-6
                col-lg-6">
          <p>However we can also see that the production of games for the Wii and its sucessor the WiiU became very small. Also there is a general decrease in video games releases for other consoles such as the X360, PS3 or PC. All those together created
            this collapse in video game releases.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row_padded">
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-8
                col-lg-8">
          <div id="console_sales_region_selector" class="row region_selector"></div>
          <div id="consoleSalesYears_container" class="row stackArea_chart"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <h2>Sales evolution</h2>
          <p>A second metric we can consider is of course the number of sales. This graph shows how many sales were made by the games released in a given year. We can see that Microsoft Xbox is essentially present only in North America and Europe, while
            Nintendo dominates the sales in Japan. In other countries it's mainly Sony making most of the sales.</p>
          <p>The general worldwide trend follows the same evolution as the previous graph, once again this collapse in sales might be explained by the arrival of smartphones games (which are not taken into account in our dataset).</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row_padded">
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <h2>Sales per genres</h2>
          <p>At last, it might be also pertinent to ask ourself which video game genre is the most present on each platform. On this graph you can select the genre you're interested in to get a better idea of which console sells the most this genre.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <p>For instance, most of the <a id="sport_games_text_button" class="interactive_text_chart">sport games</a> were sold on the Wii which is not surprising. Indeed this category has been one of the Wii's main target as Nintendo's launch title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports">Wii Sports</a>            reminds us. When it comes to <a id="puzzle_games_text_button" class="interactive_text_chart">puzzle games</a> it's Nintendo's DS that made most of the sales, surely because its stylus-driven interface and touchscreen made it ideal for this
            kind of game. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <p>Concerning <a id="shooter_games_text_button" class="interactive_text_chart">shooter games</a>, it's clearly the Playstations and Xbox that dominate the sales for this genre. And as a last example, in <a id="strategy_games_text_button" class="interactive_text_chart">strategy games</a>            playing require a lot of rapid clicks on many parts of the screen which makes nothing better than a mouse for that. This surely explains why most of strategy games sales are made on PC.</p>

          <h2>Publishers sales</h2>
          <p>Here are the top 20 publishers making the most money out of their video games sales. We decided to consider only the most popular of them, in order to make some significant observations.</p>
          <p>Since the early 1980s, Nintendo keeps a large influence in the gaming industry around the world until now. Fueled by the success of the Wii and the portable Nintendo DS, the company reaches its best Video Games sales rate around 2006 and preserved
            it until 2008. The games involved in this prosperity are especially the Super Mario Bros and the Wii Sports games. Electronic Arts is right behind and became very popular through their best-sellers like Dead Space,  Need for Speed, The Sims, FIFA,... </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-8
                col-lg-8">

      <div class="row row_padded">
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-6
                col-lg-6">
                <p>As a matter of fact, the year 2008 was a flourishing period of sales for everybody. Mirror's Edge, Dead Space, Call of Duty, Guitar Hero were for example also part of this success. Each of these most dominant corporations came all with their
                  best sellers at this time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-6
                col-lg-6">
                <p>In North America and in Europe, the popularity of the other publishers are quite similar, while in Japan the gamers swear only by japanese publishers. The war seems to be a civil war in there ! With these companies and the leadership of Nintendo,
                  Video gaming in Japan is definitely a major industry.</p>

          <p>Our final visualization relates all the games and their respective informations. For some coherence purposes, we just decided to represent the games that have an existing Critic Score, since this feature is one of the two we wanted to compare, with the Global Sales (which value was not rounded but given as it is by the dataset).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12
                col-sm-12
                col-md-4
                col-lg-4">
          <p>On the other side, the critic score of Just Dance was not as excellent as its popularity; it received an average score of 49. We can filter the games by the years, consoles, and genres, and see which one has the best score in a certain context. Thus, all mixed up, the most popular game, which is the Wii Sports Game and reaches 82.53 millions sales in the World, still has an adequate score of 76.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12

                col-lg-4">
          <p>The visualization also allows us to see the average global sales and critic scores of each publisher. It reveals some gold nuggets like Blue Byte, that has sold a few games but which seemed to be very good. With these interactivities, we can learn a lot about each game from 1850 to 2015 and their publishers and maybe discover some great games that were totally unknown until now.</p>

            <p>With different visualizations, we have shown multiple points of view about video games and their global evolution through the years. Our analysis on Console War and Publisher War present the variation of video games and their pinnacle in 2008. Looking at the genres and their sales on each console was also interesting to know on which platform a specific genre is the most played and at which period they were the most popular.</p>

            <p>Finally, our main visualization bring everything together and allows a global view on each video game. Seeing the average of publishers showed us the trend between the number of sales and the mean critic score of a publisher, but it also reveals that there exists some unpopular corporation that can make great games, although their sales were not very high. You could maybe find the best game you have ever played in here ! </p>
